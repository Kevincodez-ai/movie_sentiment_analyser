# 🎬 Movie Review Sentiment Analyzer

This project predicts the sentiment (positive or negative) of movie reviews using an ensemble of machine learning models and deep learning techniques. The models used are:

1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
3. **Naive Bayes**
4. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
5. **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory, optional)

The predictions from these models are combined using a **majority vote** mechanism to generate a final sentiment prediction.
